Visitor Login Application
This repository contains the source code and documentation for my graduation project at European University of Lefke, Faculty of Engineering.
The project is a Visitor Login Application that integrates Flutter (mobile app), Node.js + MySQL (backend), and face recognition features.

📖 Project Description
The aim of this project is to design and implement a secure visitor login system that can be used at security checkpoints.
The system ensures that visitors can register, log in, and be authenticated through QR codes and face recognition technology.

Main components:
Mobile Application (Flutter): User interface for visitors and security staff.
Backend Server (Node.js / Express): Handles user requests, database operations, and API endpoints.
Database (MySQL): Stores user records, login sessions, and encoding file references.
Face Recognition (Python/Flask): Provides face registration and authentication services.
