# Visitor Login Application
 This project is a security application developed for factories and other private institutions.

This project is a **Flutter-based mobile application** designed for visitor management and security.  
It allows users to register, log in, and access personalized features such as **QR-triggered login**, **notifications**, and **role-based video content**.  

The system is supported by two backend services:
- **Node.js + MySQL API** (visitor & user management)  
- **Python Face Recognition Server** (facial login and verification)  

ðŸ”’ For security reasons, backend repositories are kept **private**, but can be shared upon request.  
This repository contains the **Flutter client** implementation.
